# Time Sheet (Total hours approx 90 hours)

## Things to Note

I decided to re-build the farm app from scratch using a MERN stack setup (Mongodb database, express server, react and nodejs). Through extensive reading and research, I was able to implement a system to run an express/node backend concurrently with a react frontend connected to a mongoDB database. I was able to implement a redux store setup with reducers to allow the user to be created in the database and persisted once logged in, meaning even if you accidentally clicked away, you would still be recognised as the user data was persisted in localStorage. I attempted to set up allowing the game state to be converted and saved into the mongoDB database, meaning you could click the button to save your current game, and load it at a later stage if you came back to it. This proved to be too much due to the circular references of the various interdependent parts of the farm game. If I had another 20 hours dev time I would certainly like to revisit this as I believe it is something eventually that I could get working.

For the game itself, I spent some time researching Typescript and P5, to thoroughly get to grips with the inheritance of classes and advanced features such as enums, which I managed to implement as a way of changing the class of the field area in which the tractor is visiting. I have implemented 10 different animal types and ten different plant types, as well as some greener options with solar panels and green gas generators for the eco-friendly among us. I also added the option to change an area to a petting zoo for that type of animal and then back again if no longer required.  I decided to stay with class components rather than react hooks as this is all a new language to me and was better to implement this way.

I also added in a Weather Api, making use of React-Open-Weather, which uses the APIXU weather Api. With more time, I would have liked to have been able to make this affect crop growth, health etc, and use P5 to draw weather effects on the screen based on the real weather. I also made a Crypto Currency Exchange, which hooks into real-time data. The plan would have been to make this something you could exchange goods and cash for to make trading more interesting. I am proud that through the marketplace you are able to buy and sell goods, and see the budget and inventories change accordingly. I researched the use of modals to make the marketplace more interactive and also used this for the game instructions. 

I spent extensive time refactoring the visual side of the game especially the dashboards, and adding fun music and video to parts such as the marketplace, intermediary screens etc. I was able to learn how to use various additional resources such as react-sound and video-react. For the styling of the app, I researched and then used react-bootstrap and materialize, as well as standard css tricks I have learnt across the last year. There is still plenty more I would like to add to the game if I was to have more dev time to do so, such as maybe making it more fun with additional classes such as dinosaurs to give you a Jurassic Park option. I would also have liked to have been able to add more sound effects into the game, such as the noise of the tractor when it moves.

If I had more time, I would also like to extensively test the app with unit testing and continuous integration. This would allow me to further iron out any subtle nuances and improve the play and feel of the game.
